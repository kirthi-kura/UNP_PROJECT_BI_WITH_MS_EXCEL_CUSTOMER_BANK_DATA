# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_BANK_DATA

During my MBA program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of three colleagues on a data analytics project for JKVS BANK Data. We worked with a comprehensive dataset, utilizing advanced Excel tools such as pivot tables, slicers, and interactive dashboards to extract meaningful insights. Our analysis focused on identifying key trends, analysing customer spending patterns, and presenting performance data in a clear and concise manner.This project provided a hands-on application of the concepts we learned in our UNP course, offering practical experience in business data analysis. It allowed us to enhance our skills in organizing and interpreting data, applying critical thinking, and crafting visual narratives through Excel.The experience significantly strengthened my ability to manage financial data and communicate insights in a polished, professional format.
